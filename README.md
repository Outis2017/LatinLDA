# LatinLDA
I created a visualization of the topics present in various famous Roman authors and their respective texts. The Latin text corpus that I used is provided by the Classical Language Toolkit (https://github.com/cltk/cltk). This corpus consists of more than two thousand texts from different historical periods. I used Natural Language Processing techniques to do topic analysis/extract topics from processed versions of the data provided by the texts of these various authors, including topic-modeling algorithms like Latent Semantic Analysis, Positive Matrix Factorization and Latent Dirichlet Allocation to this corpus. I tokenized the text and get rid of stop words and punctuation before processing it. I used these tools and resulting visualizations to comment on the historical development of topics and discourse in Latin texts. 

The Python Notebook LatinLDA_4thMP has the relevant code for this project.
